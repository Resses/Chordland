# Chordland

Chordland is a non-violent musical shooter game that is meant to be a fun way for players to learn the notes in various chords and what they sound like. The gameplay has some elements that resemble the games Asteroids, Guitar Hero and Chroma. The goal here is to shoot down only the correct notes for the current chord being displayed, and master all the chords in the scale that you choose.
